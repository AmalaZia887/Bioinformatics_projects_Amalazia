 this repository contains a bioinformatics-based analysis of the unknown gene that we were given , including DNA, RNA, protein, subcellular localization, phylogenetic, and protein–protein interaction analyses. The project demonstrates the use of computational tools to explore gene , evolutionary conservation, and biological significance for academic and learning purposes.
Based on these all results we concluded that the unknown sequence was for Homo sapiens CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).  
NCBI BLAST, ORF finder,EXPASY, UNIPORT, VIENNA RNA WEB SERVER, OMEGA CLUSTRAL, PFARMPREDICTPROTEIN, andd other tools are used for differenet analysis.
special Thanks to Dr.Samina Shakeel for guiding us to complete this project.
